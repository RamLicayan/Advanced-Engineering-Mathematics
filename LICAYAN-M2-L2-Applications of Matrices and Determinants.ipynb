The\n","simultaneous solution of multiple equations finds its\n","way into many common engineering problems. In fact,\n","modern structural engineering analysis techniques are\n","all about solving systems of equations simultaneously.\n","Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are based on\n","matrix theory, are very important in engineering and\n","science. For example, car designers analyze eigenvalues\n","in order to damp out the noise in a car, eigenvalue\n","analysis is used in the design of car stereo systems,\n","eigenvalues can be used to test for
