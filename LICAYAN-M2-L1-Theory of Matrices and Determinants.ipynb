        ">A matrix is a kind of two-dimensional array in which each data unit has the same scale. As a result, any matrix is indeed a two-dimensional sequence, although not vice versa. Matrices are crucial data structures for certain mathematical and scientific calculations.As an electronics engineering student,one significant application of matrices in studying engineering is in the study of electrical circuits. It aids in the calculation of battery power outputs and the conversion of electrical energy into another useful energy by resistors. As a result, matrices play an important role in calculations. Particularly in solving the problems using Kirchoff’s laws of voltage and current. It assists in understanding electrical and electronics and how to utilize it correctly. Since Python doesn't have a built-in type for matrices, we can treat the matrices as a list of a list using NumPy. It is a Python library that acts as the basis for scientific computation in Python. It comprises of a collection of tools and techniques that are very useful for solving mathematical models of problems in Science and Engineering."
